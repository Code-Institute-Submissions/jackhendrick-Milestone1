Milestone Project 1 - Responsive Web Design - Full Stack Software Development - Code Institute 

<h1>Power House Fitness</h1>

<h2><b>Project Overview</b></h2>

<p>The Purpose of this website is to attract new customers and also to retain current customers. 
I kept the design simple and easy to navigate so as not to dishearten potential new customers. 
members of our gym can log onto our website and find a class they may be interested in taking.
with a free consultatin to entice new customers, and a form to give us feedback about how we're doing.</p>

<h2><b>Demo</h2></b>

<h2><b>UX</b></h2>

<p>My goal for the design for this website was to keep it nice and simple to navigate, whilst looking nice and 
giving all relative informationg without overloading the website with content.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>This site features a pop-up modal form that i got from bootstrap so users can enter they're details and get in touch with the gym to arrange a trial.</p>
<p>This site also features a google map to conviently show the location of the gym.</p>
<p>It features a timetable to show our classes available, where and when they're on.</p>
