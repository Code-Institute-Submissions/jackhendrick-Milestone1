<h1>Power House Fitness</h1>

<h2><b>Project Overview</b></h2>

<p>The Purpose of this website is to attract new customers and also to retain current customers. 
I kept the design simple and easy to navigate so as not to dishearten potential new customers. 
members of our gym can log onto our website and find a class they may be interested in taking.
